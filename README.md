## Theme Details & Demo

**Demo:** https://themes.3rdwavemedia.com/demo/bs5/devdesk/


DevDesk is a **free Bootstrap knowledge base and help centre template** I made for software developers. This template is designed to streamline your support process and reduce the need for direct product support. It adopts a clear and simple structure to ensure your customers can find answers quickly and efficiently.

All the source SCSS files are included in the free download. It's really easy to customize the color and design to suit your site’s branding identity.
